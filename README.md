# ABM-for-simulation-of-telecom-services
Business &amp; Risk  analysis 
this project is for simualtion of telecom services using java random().
we implemented DISC algorithum in order to assign the user to service provider
we used first bid auction and clark's payoff fuction 
we follow the mechanism design (ie every service provider maximize there payoff(profit) and simultaneously every user want service in cheapest rate without compromising QoS index)
